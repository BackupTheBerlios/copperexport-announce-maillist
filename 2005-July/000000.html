<PRE>Hi,

This is the first-ever message I send to the copperexport-announce  
mailing list. I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a good number  
of people subscribed to it!

I would like to announce that if you are trying out Coppermine  
1.4.1beta, you can now use CopperExport with it. I have released the  
changes that have to be made to the xp_publish.php file for it to  
recognize the additional information sent by CopperExport. You can  
get it from the project downloads section at
<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3037">https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3037</A>

I also would like to say that even though the plugin hasn't been  
updated in a while, I'm currently working on adding a few new  
features. Of high priority at the moment is automatic conversion of  
TIFF files to JPEG, for cameras that produce TIFF. Thank you for your  
patience!

In other announcements, the main CopperExport page was getting too  
long with the comments, so I have closed comments on it. For further  
questions, feedback and bug reports, please use the Forums, Features  
and Bugs sections of the project page, at
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/copperexport/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/copperexport/</A>

Thank you for all the excellent feedback, ideas, and for your  
interest in CopperExport!

Best regards,
--Diego Zamboni
