Subject: [Copperexport-announce] CopperExport 0.4.0 released
Message-ID: <1139A004-94B5-4243-B5D9-5A37BBCCEA7D@zzamboni.org>

Hi,

It's with great pleasure that I would like to announce the release of  
CopperExport 0.4.0. As usual, you can get it here:
http://www.zzamboni.org/brt/copperexport/

	Main changes:

	* Built as a universal binary - should run in both Intel- and
	  PPC-based Macs (I haven't tested it on Intel, please let me know
           if you do).
	
	* Allow saving a default resize size, which will be automatically
   	  applied to all pictures from then on.

	* Allow removing items from the list of photos to upload, directly
	  from the export dialog. This removes the photo only from the
	  upload list, not from the library (of course).

	* Reverted back to using the original filename for uploading to
	  Coppermine, rather than a generated unique ID, which was harder
	  to interpret and to handle manually on the server.
	
	* Added patches for xp_publish.php for Coppermine 1.4.3.
	
	* CopperExport now has an installer, so no manual fiddling with
	  the iPhoto plugins is necessary anymore.

	* Distribution is now in the form of a disk image.

Enjoy!
