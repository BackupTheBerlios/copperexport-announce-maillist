Hi,

It's with great pleasure that I would like to announce the release  
of  CopperExport 0.5.0. As usual, you can get it here: http:// 
zzamboni.org/brt/copperexport/

	Main changes:

	* Works with iPhoto7 (part of iLife'08)
	
	* Tested on both PPC and Intel platforms.

	* Added server-side patches for Coppermine versions up to 1.4.13.

	* Fixed an old-standing bug that would prevent uploads in some
	cases, producing an HTTP 406 error (thanks to nonplus for the
	patch).

Enjoy!

--Diego
