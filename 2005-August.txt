Hi,

After some time of inactivity, there is finally a new release of  
CopperExport. The big new feature is automatic conversion of non-JPEG  
images to JPEG before uploading, plus some other new features and bug  
fixes. Get it here: http://www.zzamboni.org/copperexport/

As usual, big thanks go to Fraser Speirs for FlickrExport. Most of  
the new code in this new release comes from him.

Thank you,
--Diego
